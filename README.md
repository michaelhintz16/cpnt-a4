karts R US is a fully indoor go kart facility. fun for friends and the family or come alone and meet new people.
This is just a simple little website. on the top you have the logo and a background image both responsive. then you got the nav bar just below it also responsive,
then you got the hero image. when i resised it the image got a little distorted. then right below it is the card blocks thesee are the riders top 3 riders of the week. 
and below that is just some fun i had with the website i added prices so you know how much it costs. and below that is just a footer image with a footer copyright tag. 

# Troubles 
* so i had trouble at first getting the hero image to be larger, and how i fixed that was i removed some code in my html. the container to be exact. it was causing the image to be only 100% of the container not the page.

* The prices are a little small and off to the side instead of larger and in the middele that i could not get to work.
